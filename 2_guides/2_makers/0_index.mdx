# Maker's Guides

Makers is the connected object's designer.

Maker can be a simple enthusiast that create his own project, or be a company that design a new connected product. Regardless of who you are, on these pages you can find guides to learn how to create your own connected objects or integrate existing connected objects or communication protocols/standards.

Depending on your needs these HowTos help you create a full working John Object or a shareable JOD Distribution.
