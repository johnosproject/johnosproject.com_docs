# How to visualize JOSP Object's info and structure

import YoutubeVideo from '../../../3_references/_video_youtube.mdx'

Each JOSP Object is configured with a structure containing all exposed object's features.
Depending on what the JOSP Object is representing, this structure can expose different Pillars.

Show object's structure is really easy.
It's enough open a Johnny Service and select a JOSP Object from the object's list.
Then the service display the object view that contains both object's details and his structure.

1. ### Open a JOSP Service

You can choose your favourite Johnny Service.<br/>
If not, [login to the service](../user_account/login_and_out) with your JOSP credentials to show all your JOSP objects.

2. ### Search object

When on the service, go to the 'Object's list' and look for the JOSP object you are interested in.
You can use available controls to filters objects by name, id or type.

3. ### Show object

Click on desired JOSP Object's label/button to open object's main view.<br/>
Depending on which Johnny Service are you using you can see all object's details and browse his structure.
