**The John O.S. Platform is a next-gen IoT Platform.**<br/>
This platform allows anybody to create custom IoT Solutions in minutes.
[Register](/guides/end_users/new_objects/register_object) your connected objects to the JOSP EcoSystem, then [interact](/guides/end_users/manage_services/use_objects) with them from any software enabled.<br/>
**That's it! Your IoT Solution is ready.**

This is the JOSP Docs official website.
Within those pages you can find all [JOSP Project](/what/josp/)'s related documentation.<br/>
Because the IoT world introduce many new concepts and there are many IoT Actors with different levels of knowledge, the JOSP Docs are organized in 3 main sections.

* the **['What is?'](/what)** section describe what is IoT and introduce the JOSP Project
* in the **[Guides](/guides)** section there are all user's guides grouped by End User, Makers and Developer
* finally, in the **[Reference](/references)** section are contained all references of JOSP Project's software and tools

## What the JOSP Project provides?

The JOSP Project not only provide a **ready-to-use JOSP EcoSystem**, with the [Public JCP platform](/references/josp/jcp/public_jcp), but also **all EcoSystem's components as Open Source** software and libraries.<br/>
In the JOSP Projects, an EcoSystem can be composed by 3 main components:

<div style={{
  textAlign: 'center',
  margin: '48px 0',
  maxWidth: '500px',
  margin: '2em auto'
}}>
  <img
    src={require('/Index_BasicIoTEcoSystem.png').default}
  />
</div>

* **[John Object Daemon](/references/josp/jod/)**<br/>
  It is the JOSP Object's agent.
  This software is generally installed into the connected object (or locally near him) and translate the JOSP's messages to firmware calls.
* **[John Service Library](/references/josp/jsl/)**<br/>
  It is the software library that can be included in 3rd party software to enable the JOSP support.
  Once a software incudes the JSL Library it becomes a JOSP Service and can interact with JOSP Objects.
* **[John Cloud Platform](/references/josp/jcp/)**<br/>
  It's the cloud component for JOSP Solutions.
  This cloud platform, mainly, provides the cloud communication between JOSP Objects and Services.

Those components can be used to setup your own JOSP EcoSystem.
Or to create [JOSP Objects](/what/josp/object) and [Services](/what/josp/service) as IoT Components to be used in [JOSP Solutions](/what/josp/solution).<br/>
The JOSP Project provides also a set of **tools and guidelines to manage and design JOSP Objects and Services**:

<div style={{
  textAlign: 'center',
  margin: '48px 0',
  maxWidth: '600px',
  margin: '2em auto'
}}>
  <img
    src={require('/Index_IoTEcoSystemAndActors.png').default}
  />
</div>

* How **[End Users](/what/josp/actors/end_user)** can [manage their connected objects](/guides/end_users/manage_objects) from a single point of reference
* The [Johnny Services](/references/jsl_services/#johnny-services) as user interfaces to handle JOSP Objects
* The [John Remote Object](/references/tools/john_object_remote/) as tool to manage JOSP Objects on remote devices


* How **[Makers](/what/josp/actors/maker)** can [create a connected JOSP Object](/guides/makers/object_integration/create_object) or [integrate existing connected objects](/guides/makers/design_objects/create_distribution) with a JOD Distribution
* The [JOD Distribution TEMPLATE](/references/tools/jod_dist_template/) as starting point for custom JOD Distributions
* All published [JOSP Objects](/references/jod_dists/#real-physical-objects) and [JOD Distributions](/references/jod_dists/) (they can be used as examples)


* How **[Developers](/what/josp/actors/developer)** can [implement IoT features](/guides/developers/interact_with_objects/initialize_jsl) in their Mobile, Desktop and Web software
* All published [JOSP Services](/references/jsl_services/) (they can be used as source of inspiration)

## Getting started

Depending on your purposes, you can start reading related documentation to:

import { styled } from '@mui/material/styles';
import Box from '@mui/material/Box';
import Grid from '@mui/material/Grid';
import Paper from '@mui/material/Paper';

export const paper_style = {
padding: '2em',
width: '90%',
margin: 'auto',
}

<Box sx={{ flexGrow: 1 }}>
<Grid container spacing={2}

alignItems="center">
<Grid item sm={12} md={2}>
<img src={require('/img/icons/End_User_Icon_250.png').default} />
</Grid>
<Grid item sm={12} md={10} style={{paddingLeft: '2em'}}>

### [End Users](/guides/end_users/)

**Create a JOSP Solutions**

* [Register a new user's account](/) to the Public JCP

## Collaborate

This is an Open Source project, and there are many ways to help and collaborate in the JOSP Project:

* Share your JOSP Objects's as JOD Distributions
* Implement JOSP Services and add them to JOSP Services list
* Help to resolve bugs and implement new features to the JOSP Core project
* Improve existing docs or write new Guides and HowTos

At the same time we are always looking for new use cases and demos.
So, whether you have just an idea or are already implementing your IoT solution, don't hesitate to contact us.
We will be happy to discuss with you about tech decisions and help build your solution with Johnâ€™s component.

Please contact us at [tech@johnosproject.com](mailto:tech@johnosproject.com).
