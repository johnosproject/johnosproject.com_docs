# IoT Objects

In 2020, objects connected to the internet exceeded 20 billion, and new ones are created every day.

Today, as End Users **on the market there are thousands types of connected objects to integrate in our [IoT Solutions](solution)**.
Unfortunately, there are also a lot of different technologies to connect these objects.
Each of them with different communication channels and protocols.<br/>
That make harder integrate them in our IoT Solutions.

We have the same problems if, on other hands, our goal is to **create a new connected object to use it in IoT Solutions**.
We still must select a technology to use to make our object and to use in our services to interact with connected objects.

Once the object is connected to an [EcoSystem](ecosystem), it can become available for all [services](service) connected to the same EcoSystem and then also to solutions [actors](actor).

## Choose IoT Objects

When we choose a connected object, or when we create a new one, for our IoT Solution, it **is good to know object's specifications**.
When we design our IoT Solution, it **is good to know object's specifications**.<br/>
To keep things simple, we can split each connected object in 2 parts:

* Communication layer: which communication channel and protocols are used by the object
* Features list: which values and which commands can be read/executed from the object 

A first selection of existing connected objects for our solutions can be made **filtering objects by their features**.
Depending on what our users need to do with objects, we can choose to design our IoT Solution based on certain products instead of others.
For example, if we are designing a car sharing IoT Solution, we certainly care that the cars provide the kilometers traveled, so that we can calculate and invoice their use.

In a second step, we can **compare the communication specifications** of each object found.
Those specifications will affect the infrastructure required by our IoT Solution.<br/>
Because of that, when the IoT Solution involves many objects of different types (light, door, temperature sensors...), it's common choose objects that supports the same protocol / communication layer.
So the infrastructure for your solution, have support only that protocol.

Designing your IoT Solution, you must consider also **objects interoperability and alternative products**.<br/>
What happen if we choose a connected object and then his manufacturer dismiss it? Can we switch to another product? With which effort?
Because of that, it is always good practice selecting at least one alternative product for each object envisaged in our solution.
The more alternative products our solution can use, the more it adapts to user needs.
Furthermore, the use of alternative products can also significantly increase the target market.<br/>

## Anatomy of an object

Most of the time, it's enough define an object by his communication layer and the features it exposes.

To go more deep on object's details, we can split it again.
Both, object's communication and features, can be split in hardware and software subcomponents:

* (HW) Communication Module:<br/>
  the hardware with a physical interface to tx/rx on the communication channel (lan, wifi, proprietary buses...).
* (SW) Communication protocol:<br/>
  communication module's firmware and the protocol implementation are the software in charge to handle the object's communication and defines the object's 'language'.
* (SW) Firmware:<br/>
  the software that allow to interact with sensors and actuators, it includes also some basic object's processing logic (aka edge computing).
* (HW) Sensors and Actuators:<br/>
  most of the connected objects includes also physical sensors and electromechanical actuators.

As long as we don't have to create our object, we can not worry about these details.

## Object's features

To define a connected object by his features is pretty easy.<br/>
You can group object's features in two groups:

* Values: which values the object can provide to the services
* Commands: which commands the services can execute on the object

**Each connected object provide values about his state or about his sensors**.
Those values can be used by services to populate a database for analytics, to execute automation tasks or to display the object's status to the users.
For example a connected thermostat provide the room's temperature (as value) to the air conditioning software, that decides whether to turn on the heating or cooling. 

**Some object allows connected software execute commands remotely.**
Services can send a command request to objects, that (after a permissions check) execute required command.
Commonly commands act to object's actuators like relay, motors or other electromechanical components.
In most cases for each command to execute on a connected object, there is also a corresponding value.
For example a connected lamp can be switch on/off from services via command requests, but it also provides his state switched on/off as a value.

While not always completely true, the following table helps you understand how to identify the capabilities of an object.

| Hardware | | Firmware | | Service |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sensor | > | Value | > | State |
| Actuator | < | Command | < | Action |

## Communication

**An object can be connected with services via many communication channels.**

When the object's support the IP networks (Lan or Wi-Fi), it's the easiest case.
In this case, the **object is connected to a local network** then it can be reachable by services directly, software must run on the same local network.
Alternatively, if the local network provides a public internet access, services can reach the object also via cloud.
Both, services and objects have to connect to a cloud component that act as gateways routing messages between object and services and vice-versa.

Also, when the object can connect to a mobile network, or **any other network with a public internet connection available**, it can connect to the cloud gateway.
Then it will be reachable from services but only via the cloud gateway.

But what happen if the object don't support IP network natively?<br/>
Today on the market there are thousands of connected objects that are using dozens of different communication protocols/standard.
For example KNX, ZigBee and LonWorks are among the most famous standards of this type in home automation.<br/>
Instead connecting to an IP network, many **objects connects to a proprietary/dedicated bus defined by a protocol/standard**.
The bus is a physical communication channel used by object to communicate with other objects that support the same protocol.
For almost all communication protocols exists a gateway (from the specific protocol to IP networks) already available on the market.
Those gateways allow software interact with objects: the software sends his request to the gateway (over IP network) that translate them to specific protocol's message and finally, forward it to the right object (over the bus).<br/>
Be careful when choosing the gateway for your IoT Solution, because each gateway provide different interfaces to the software (on IP side).
Check the gateway's documentation for more details how software can interact with it.

## Create connected objects

Sometimes we need to create custom connected object to use in our IoT Solution.
This generally occurs in two cases:

* there is no product already on the market that meets your requirements
* you want to create your own IoT object and the related control / monitoring software

To create a connected object you can start from scratch implementing all components and setting up required infrastructure.
This way is really expensive and hard to maintain or scale up.<br/>
A better way is to use tools available on the market like IoT Platforms.
Many of them are based on hardware devices and provides the infrastructure needed to communicate from object to software and vice-versa.
Others are more flexible and allow you to choose between different hardware devices.
Basically **those tools provides you an easy way to prototype your connected object and the IoT Infrastructure used by services to interact with objects**.

Because also all those tools are using different communication layers, you must choose the right platform depending on your IoT Solution's requirement.

## Product’s improved value

From a manufacturer point of view, **connected products open a wide range of possibilities**.
Such as:

* provide premium services to his customers<br/>
  (remote support and assistant, predictive maintenance, customer fidelity, product as a services business models…);
* known better customer and their needs<br/>
  (product usage stats, consumable refill routines, favourite configurations)
* keep secure and update products<br/>
  (JOD and Utils & Apps OTA updates, object structure remote upgrade)

But even more important, a connected object’s value comes from 3rd parties.
External Developers, from big software houses to garage startups, can use your connected object in their IoT Solutions.
That means a **single product can be used for multiple purposes**, also on solutions the manufacturer didn't think about.

For example when you purchase a connected car, it is provided with a beautiful mobile app from the car manufacturer.
But what happens if your home’s gate can talk with vehicles but yours is not included in the integrated cars list?
You can’t configure your gate to open automatically when you drive back home with your own car.
Or what happens if you bought that car for your company fleet?
You must ask your ERP software provider to integrate that connected car to ERP’s vehicle management system.
That’s can be really expensive.

**When design a connected object remember that: every time a connected object can be used in a new IoT Solutions, more customers would purchase that object.**
