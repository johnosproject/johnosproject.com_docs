A JOSP Objects is the representation of an object in the JOSP EcoSystem.
JOSP EcoSystem, expose object's features to other JOSP Services.<br/>

A JOSP Objects can be configured to represent any kind of connected object, regardless the tecnology used to connect it.
It can be also configured to represent custom objects such as Native JOSP Objects.
Purchasable products or maker's projects that come with a pre-installed JOD Agent.

<br/>

A JOSP Object, from [JOSP Services](service) perspective is a set of structured features represented by [JOSP Pillars](specs/pillar).
This structure, plus a set of info like id, name, model, etc..., allows services identify objects and differentiate them by their capabilities.<br/>
Object's features exposed to the [JOSP EcoSystem](ecosystem) allow services to interact with the object.
Depending on the feature, services can query a status value or request to execute an action to connected objects.

It's really important how an object expose his features to the JOSP EcoSystem.
If it contains common features, it can be found and used by many JOSP Service; but if the object result to generic it is discarded in preference to other more specific objects.

**JOSP Objects info and structure are defined to the [Maker](actors/maker).**
Maker is who configure the JOD Agent, the software that expose JOSP Objects to the EcoSystem.<br/>
Typically Maker is the manufacturer of the product or, the maker that designed the connected object.
Other times, JOSP Objects are distributed as [JOD Distributions](/references/jod_dists/), downloadable archives that contains all files to run a JOSP Object.
Those JOD Distributions can be even customized by end users to adapt them to their hardware setup.<br/>
Starting point to create a new JOD Distribution is the [JOD Dist TMPL](/references/tools/jod_dist_template/) project that provide a directory to use as template for customizable JOD Distributions.

**[End Users](actors/end_user) run a JOSP Object** each time they plug in the electrical outlet of a Native JOSP Object, or each time they start up a JOD Distribution.
Once executed, a JOSP Object continues to run 24/7 and can be used in any [JOSP Solution](solution).

## What is a JOSP Object

A JOSP Objects is the representation of a connected object in the JOSP EcoSystem.<br/>
The communication between the JOSP EcoSystem and the represented objects is delegated to the JOD Agent.
This is a software that can be executed on embedded devices, on personal computers or on servers, depending on the object to represent.
This agent manages object's communications, permissions and translate the JOSP Protocol messages from/to JOSP Services and represented object.
