I'm happy to announce the **John OS Platform version 2.0.0**.

We published the first release of the 2.x.x series.<br/>
It includes the JOD Agent, the JSL library and a minimal implementation of the JCP platform (JCP APIs and JCP GWs).<br/>
With this version you can startup a JOSP EcoSystem with multiple JOSP Objects and Services that can communicate directly or via JCP.

The John OS Platform project provide a suit of software and tools to simplify the IoT solutions design. From his source code's ```README.md``` file:

:::note The John O.S. Project (JOSP for friends) simplify the design and build process of modern [Internet of Things solutions](https://bitbucket.org/johnosproject_shared/com.robypomper.josp/src/2.0.0/docs/josp_ecosystems.md):

* reduces **smart object's creation a 5 minutes activity**, even without coding skills
* it's possible integrate any kind of connected object, regardless of communication protocol used by the object
* develop custom **software that easily interact with objects**
* startups local and cloud connections between service and objects out-of-the-box
* it provides communication **security and object's access control by design**
* it's completely Open Source
  :::

This version introduces all 3 main components for a JOSP EcoSystem.

* The **Object's agent [JOSP JOD](https://bitbucket.org/johnosproject_shared/com.robypomper.josp/src/2.0.0/docs/jospJOD/README.md)** can be installed on a smart object and allow to expose all object's status and actions to services like the environment temperature or ths light status.
* Services are **all software that include the [JOSP JSL](https://bitbucket.org/johnosproject_shared/com.robypomper.josp/src/2.0.0/docs/jospJSL/README.md) library**. This library allows software easily interact with JOD objects:
  1. listing and filter available objects,
  1. getting status updates and
  1. send action commands.
* The **cloud components [JCP APIs](https://bitbucket.org/johnosproject_shared/com.robypomper.josp/src/2.0.0/docs/jcpAPIs/README.md) and the [JOSP GWs](https://bitbucket.org/johnosproject_shared/com.robypomper.josp/src/2.0.0/docs/jospGWs/README.md)** components allow objects and services to communicate also remotely via Cloud.

To start experiment with your own IoT Eco-System see the [JOSP Project documentation](https://bitbucket.org/johnosproject_shared/com.robypomper.josp/src/2.0.0/docs/INDEX.md).
