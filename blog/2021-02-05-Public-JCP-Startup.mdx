Today **we launched the public John Cloud Platform instances**.

From today, you can go to [www.johnosproject.org/frontend](https://www.johnosproject.org/frontend) and access to your IoT EcoSystem. Let's start connect objects and interact with them directly from the web or one of the [JOSP Services](/docs/references/jsl_services/).

<!--truncate-->

The new JCP Front End is now available as the entire John Cloud Platform at [johnosproject.org](https://www.johnosproject.org). Now you can connect your JOSP Objects and Services to this Public JCP instance and enable the cloud communication troughs objects and services.

Let's go to the new JCP Front End and register yourself, then looks for [JOD Distributions list](/docs/references/jod_dists/) for a list of connectable objects.
