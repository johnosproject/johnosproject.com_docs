Here the release **John OS Platform version 2.1.0** (not released).

This version did not approve the release process. So it's only an internal version. It includes updates for the JOD Agent, the JSL library and the JCP platform components JCP APIs and JCP GWs. It includes also a partial implementation of the JCP FE and JCP JSL WB microservice of the JCP platform.
