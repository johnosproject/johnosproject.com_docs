# Distribution's requirements

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

:::caution
This distribution can be installed on Linux or MacOS.
:::

This distribution use the [```scripts/hw/generateObjectStructure_ALL.sh```](https://bitbucket.org/johnosproject_shared/com.robypomper.josp.jod.mbus/src/master/dists/resources/scripts/hw/generateObjectStructure_ALL.sh) or [```scripts/hw/generateObjectStructure_SLAVE.sh```](https://bitbucket.org/johnosproject_shared/com.robypomper.josp.jod.mbus/src/master/dists/resources/scripts/hw/generateObjectStructure_SLAVE.sh) scripts to generate the object structure on his startup.
Those scripts and the resulting object's structure require the ```mbus-serial-scan``` and ```mbus-serial-request-data``` external commands.

Those commands are provided within the [```libmbus```](https://github.com/rscada/libmbus) library.

:::tip

## Install ```libmbus```

The ```libmbus``` library provide also a set of tools to interact with a MBus master via serial or tcp communication.
This distribution, at this moment, support only serial communication.

To install this library on your system (where you intend run the JOD MBus distribution), you can download it from the [download libmbus](http://www.rscada.se/libmbus/) page or following instruction from your MBus master.
Here the links to setup guides of some MBus master available for RaspberryPi:
