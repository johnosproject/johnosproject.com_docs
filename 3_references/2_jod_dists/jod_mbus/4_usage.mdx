# Distribution usage

**This distribution is based on JOD Distribution TEMPLATE**.

That means it inherits all JOD Distribution Commands to manage installed instance.
So you can execute

```shell
$ bash start.sh         # for Linux and MacOS
$ powershell start.sh   # for Windows
```

command to run installed JOD Distribution as a JOSP Object instance.

More info on how to install and manage a JOD Distribution at following links from JOD Distribution TEMPLATE's' docs:
* [Configure a JOD Distribution](/references/tools/jod_dist_template/how_to_use_a_jod_distribution/configure_a_jod_distribution)
* [Run a JOD Distribution](/references/tools/jod_dist_template/how_to_use_a_jod_distribution/run_a_jod_distribution)
* [Install a JOD Distribution as a Service](/references/tools/jod_dist_template/how_to_use_a_jod_distribution/install_a_jod_distribution_as_a_service)

:::caution
The JOD MBus distribution actually can used with a small number of slaves connected to the MBus master.
Thats because when it's configured with too many statuses (from many slaves), it starts to be unstable, due to sending too many requests through ```mbus-serial-request-data``` command.

This bug is already under resolution at [JOSPTU-75](https://johnosproject.atlassian.net/browse/JOSPTU-75).
