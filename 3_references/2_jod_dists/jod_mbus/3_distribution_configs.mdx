# Distribution configuration

The JOD MBus distribution can be configured **setting the working mode ALL!SLAVE and the serial communication (via libmbus) to the MBus master** to represent with current JOSP Object.

Edit the ```configs/configs.sh``` files and set ```JOD_MBUS_**``` properties.<br/>

* ```JOD_MBUS_TYPE```: working mode selector, can be one of following values ```ALL``` or ```SLAVE```.
* ```JOD_MBUS_DEV```: serial device where the MBus master is connected, example ```/dev/ttyAMA0```.
* ```JOD_MBUS_BAUD```: serial port baud rate, example ```2400```.

For ALL mode:

* ```JOD_MBUS_ADDR_TYPE```: which MBus address to use, can be one of following values ```primary``` or ```secondary```.

For SLAVE mode:

* ```JOD_MBUS_SLAVE_ADDR```: slave's address, example ```394335734D6A8104``` or ```94782644C5140004```

Once you set the ```configs/configs.sh``` file, you can [execute](usage) the JOSP Object.

You can also **change configured MBus Master or slave after the JOSP Object startup**.
Update the Hub's address, update your configs and restart the JOSP Object.
It will be disconnected from all JOSP Service (and from the JCP Gateway), and then reconnected with the updated object's structure.
