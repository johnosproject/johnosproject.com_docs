# Distribution configuration

The JOD AA ODH distribution can be configured **setting the Alto Adige Open Data Hub station** to represent with current JOSP Object.

Edit the ```configs/configs.sh``` files and set ```JOD_AA_ODH_STATION_TYPE``` and ```JOD_AA_ODH_STATION_CODE``` properties.<br/>
You can find valid values in the Dataset list from [distribution home page](.#station-types-list).

Once you set the ```configs/configs.sh``` file, you can [execute](usage) the JOSP Object.

You can also **change configured station after the JOSP Object startup**.
Update the station's values and restart the JOSP Object.
It will be disconnected from all JOSP Service (and from the JCP Gateway), and then reconnected with the updated object's structure.
