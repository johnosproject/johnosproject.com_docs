# Distribution configuration

The JOD Philips Hue distribution can be configured **setting the Philips Hue Hub** to represent with current JOSP Object.

Edit the ```configs/configs.sh``` files and set ```HUE_GW_**``` properties.<br/>

* ```HUE_GW_NAME```: Hub name as it appears on the official Philips Hue app.
* ```HUE_GW_ADDR```: Hub address, normally it correspond to ```$HUE_GW_NAME.local```.
  You can retrieve Philips Hub gateway's address following one of the method suggested by this [guide](https://developers.meethue.com/develop/get-started-2/#follow-3-easy-steps) at 'Step 2'.
* ```HUE_GW_USER```: Hub user's name, whatever you wants. By default it's ```jod_philips_hue```.
* ```HUE_GW_DEVELOPER```: Optional value, set with user's id returned from the Hub user's registration.

If the ```HUE_GW_DEVELOPER``` property is not set, this distribution at his first startup execute the user's registration procedure.
**So you must press the button on top of your Philips Hue Hub.**
After that, it store the generated user's id as ```HUE_GW_DEVELOPER``` for the next execution.

Once you set the ```configs/configs.sh``` file, you can [execute](usage) the JOSP Object.

You can also **change configured Philips Hue Hub after the JOSP Object startup**.
Update the Hub's address, remove the ```HUE_GW_DEVELOPER``` value and restart the JOSP Object.
It will be disconnected from all JOSP Service (and from the JCP Gateway), and then reconnected with the updated object's structure.
