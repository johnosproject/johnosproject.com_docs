# Distribution usage

**This distribution is based on JOD Distribution TEMPLATE**.

That means it inherits all JOD Distribution Commands to manage installed instance.
So you can execute

```shell
$ bash start.sh         # for Linux and MacOS
$ powershell start.sh   # for Windows
```

command to run installed JOD Distribution as a JOSP Object instance.

More info on how to install and manage a JOD Distribution at following links from JOD Distribution TEMPLATE's' docs:

:::info
The JOD Philips Hue distribution require a valid ```HUE_GW_DEVELOPER``` (the user's id registered on Hub).
So when it's not set, **at first distribution startup is required to press the bottom on top of the Philips Hue Hub**.
After a successfully startup, the value is stored for future startups.

If you are not able to press the bottom, the startup fails and no JOSP Object is initialized.
