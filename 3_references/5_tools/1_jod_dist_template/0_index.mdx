A JOD Distribution is a compressed folder that contains all libraries, scripts and configuration to run a JOD agent that represent a specific John Object. Generated distributions can be executed on local machine, deployed on remote objects or shared with other users.

![JOD Distribution TEMPLATE LifeCycle diagram](/references/tools/jod_dist_template/JODDistTMPL_Overview.png "JOD Distribution TEMPLATE LifeCycle")

A JOD Distribution, once executed, expose represented object's features to the [John O.S. Platform](https://www.johnosproject.org/docs/index.html) Ecosystem.

Any Maker can create a new JOD Distribution simply extracting latest JOD Distribution TEMPLATE artifacts; and then configuring extracted files. After that, Maker can build, tests and publish his own JOD Distributions.

**With JOD Distribution TEMPLATE makers can:**

* Create a full working JOD Distribution
* Customize object's info, configs and structure
* Choose the JOD versions to use
* Add custom firmware files
* Customize JOD Instance management

At [JOD Distributions list](/docs/references/jod_dists/) page of the JOSP Docs, you can find many ready-to-use JOD Distributions. Depending on what you would integrate to the JOSP EcoSystem as an Object, maybe there is already a JOD Distribution for your needs. Otherwise, use them as examples for your custom JOD Distribution.<br/>
To publish your own distribution on this list, please contact us at [tech@johnosproject.com](mailto:tech@johnosproject.com).
