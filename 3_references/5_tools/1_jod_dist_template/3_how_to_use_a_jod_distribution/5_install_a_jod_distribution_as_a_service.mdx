# Install a JOD Distribution as a Service

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'; import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'; import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

When you run a JOD Distribution with the ```start.sh|ps1``` [JOD Dist Cmd](https://bitbucket.org/johnosproject_shared/com.robypomper.josp.jod.template/src/develop/docs/dists/dists.md), it can still run until the operating system reboots; but after that the distribution must be re-started manually.

To avoid this operation, you can **install the JOD Distribution as a service in the working operating system**. That means the operating system take care to restart the distribution on each boot. So you can safely switch on/off the device where you installed the JOD Distribution, without worry to restart it each time.

:::caution
```install.sh|ps1``` and ```uninstall.sh|ps1``` JOD Dist Cmd require administrator permission on working machine. So during the process, they will ask you to grant admin access.
:::

Depending on where you [copied JOD Distribution's files](get_a_jod_distribution), you must [open a terminal session](run_a_jod_distribution#open-terminal-session) and execute the ```install.sh|ps1``` JOD Dist Cmd from ```$JOD_DIST_DIR``` folder.
