# Test JOD Distribution

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'; import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'; import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

Once you are ready to startup and test your JOD Distribution; depending on wht you need to test, different execution modes are available.

You can change execution mode via the ```JCP_ENV``` property in the ```configs/jod_dist_configs.sh|ps1``` file from [JOD Distribution configs](configuration/distribution_configs). Then each [JOD Template Commands](https://bitbucket.org/johnosproject_shared/com.robypomper.josp.jod.template/src/develop/docs/tmpl/tmpl.md) scripts generate a JOD Distribution with updated ```JCP_ENV``` mode. Available modes are:

* ```local```: distribution will use a local John Cloud Platform (local JCP not required)
* ```stage```: distribution will use the [Stage Public JCP](https://stage.johnosproject.org/frontend/index.html)
* ```prod```: distribution will use the [Public JCP](https://www.johnosproject.org/frontend/index.html)

Use the ```prod``` mode only when release and publish your distribution.

If you are just **testing that's your distribution works**, you can execute it in ```local``` mode. Then you can execute it in a local environment. Don't worry if you have not a JCP instance running locally, your distribution will run anyway a JOSP Object that allow you to fully test your JOD Distribution.

If **your tests requires a full working environment**, for example for a long-time test or in a real-world conditions test; you can use the ```stage``` mode for JOD Distribution execution and connect also your JOSP Services to the [Stage Public JCP](https://stage.johnosproject.org/frontend/index.html).

The ```configs/jod_dist_configs.sh|ps1``` file from [JOD Distribution configs](configuration/distribution_configs) allow you also build JOD Distribution with prefixed values for object's name, ids and even object's owner. Almost all **properties from ```configs/jod.yml``` file can be overridden**. Only ```JCP_ID``` and ```JCP_SECRET``` properties are mandatory and must be set according to ```JCP_ENV```.

:::info For ```JCP_ENV='local'```, ```JCP_ID``` and ```JCP_SECRET``` values depends on local JCP instance. If no local JCP is available, use any value to skipp mandatory check.<br/>
For ```JCP_ENV='stage'```, ```JCP_ID``` and ```JCP_SECRET``` values can be ```test-client-obj``` and ```2d1f9b96-70d3-443b-b21b-08a401ddc16c``` or request your own at [tech@johnosproject.com](mailto:tech@johnosproject.com).<br/>
:::

After configure the execution modes and other JOD Distribution's configs, you must choose if execute the testing distribution locally on your working machine, or remotely on a network device. Then if you choose the local execution, other two options are available: 'build dir' or 'env dir'.

## Test locally from build dir

To run your JOD distribution locally from the build dir, before you must build it with the ```scripts/build.sh|ps1``` script. That creates the ```build/assemble/{DEST_VER}``` directory containing your distribution.

<Tabs groupId="os-shell"
defaultValue="bash"
values={[
{label: 'Linux/Mac', value: 'bash'}, {label: 'Windows', value: 'powershell'},
]}>
<TabItem value="bash">

Run JOD Distribution as a background process and review his logs:

```shell title="Test distribution locally from build dir as Background process"
$ bash script/build.sh
$ cd build/assemble/{DEST_VER}
$ bash start.sh
$
$ tail -f logs/jospJOD.log
$ tail -f logs/console.log    // includes more details (p.e. SIGTERM)
$
$ bash stop.sh
```

or as foreground process:

```shell title="Test distribution locally from build dir as Foreground process"
$ bash script/build.sh
$ cd build/assemble/{DEST_VER}
$ bash start.sh true
  < Type exit to halt the JOD Agent
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="powershell">

Run JOD Distribution as a background process and review his logs:

```shell title="Test distribution locally from build dir as Background process"
$ powershell script/build.ps1
$ cd build/assemble/{DEST_VER}
$ powershell start.ps1
$
$ Get-Content -Path logs/jospJOD.log -Tail 100 -Wait
$ Get-Content -Path logs/console.log -Tail 100 -Wait    // includes more details (p.e. SIGTERM)
$
$ powershell stop.ps1
```

or as foreground process:

```shell title="Test distribution locally from build dir as Foreground process"
$ powershell script/build.ps1
$ cd build/assemble/{DEST_VER}
$ powershell start.ps1 FOREGROUND
  < Type exit to halt the JOD Agent
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::caution Build directory will reset each time you execute JOD Template Commands. For persistence distribution tests, please see [Test locally from env dir](#test-locally-from-env-dir).

## Test locally from env dir

To help you testing your JOD Distribution in a persistent environment, the JOD Template Commands provides you the ```scripts/install.sh|ps1``` script. That script build your distribution, then copy it to a random directory ```envs/{DEST_ARTIFACT}-{DEST_VER}/{RANDOM_NUMBER}```. So each time you execute the ```scripts/install.sh|ps1``` script, a new directory with a fresh installation will be created.

The ```scripts/install.sh|ps1``` script print the created dir on his log.

<Tabs groupId="os-shell"
defaultValue="bash"
values={[
{label: 'Linux/Mac', value: 'bash'}, {label: 'Windows', value: 'powershell'},
]}>
<TabItem value="bash">

Install and run JOD Distribution as a background process and review his logs:

```shell title="Test distribution locally from env dir as Background process"
$ bash script/install.sh
$ cd envs/{DEST_ARTIFACT}-{DEST_VER}/{RANDOM_NUMBER}
$ bash start.sh
$
$ tail -f logs/jospJOD.log
$ tail -f logs/console.log    // includes more details (p.e. SIGTERM)
$
$ bash stop.sh
```

or as foreground process:

```shell title="Test distribution locally from env dir as Foreground process"
$ bash script/install.sh
$ cd envs/{DEST_ARTIFACT}-{DEST_VER}/{RANDOM_NUMBER}
$ bash start.sh true
  < Type exit to halt the JOD Agent
```

  <TabItem value="powershell">

Install and run JOD Distribution as a background process and review his logs:

```shell title="Test distribution locally from env dir as Background process"
$ powershell script/install.ps1
$ cd envs/{DEST_ARTIFACT}-{DEST_VER}/{RANDOM_NUMBER}
$ powershell start.ps1
$
$ Get-Content -Path logs/jospJOD.log -Tail 100 -Wait
$ Get-Content -Path logs/console.log -Tail 100 -Wait    // includes more details (p.e. SIGTERM)
$
$ powershell stop.ps1

$ powershell script/install.ps1
$ cd envs/{DEST_ARTIFACT}-{DEST_VER}/{RANDOM_NUMBER}
$ powershell start.ps1 FOREGROUND
  < Type exit to halt the JOD Agent
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::caution Installed JOD Distribution will persist across JOD Template Commands execution. For a fresh installation, please execute again the ```script/install.sh|ps1``` script, or use the [Test locally from env build](#test-locally-from-build-dir).

## Test remotely

Many times you are designing a JOD Distribution that must run on a remote device, so you need to deploy and test it on remote device.

Because of that, here the guide to:

1. create a compressed JOD Distribution archive
1. upload it to a remote host
1. run your custom JOD Distribution on remote host

<Tabs groupId="os-shell"
defaultValue="bash"
values={[
{label: 'Linux/Mac', value: 'bash'}, {label: 'Windows', value: 'powershell'},
]}>
<TabItem value="bash">

Publish, upload and run remotely JOD Distribution as a background process and review his logs:

```shell title="Test distribution remotely as Background process"
$ bash script/publish.sh
$ scp build/publications/{DEST_ARTIFACT}-{DEST_VER}.tgz [{REMOTE_USER}@]{REMOTE_HOST}:{REMOTE_PATH}
$ ssh [{REMOTE_USER}@]{REMOTE_HOST}
REMOTE_HOST $ cd {REMOTE_PATH}
REMOTE_HOST $ tar -xvz {DEST_ARTIFACT}-{DEST_VER}.tgz
REMOTE_HOST $ cd {DEST_ARTIFACT}-{DEST_VER}
REMOTE_HOST $ bash start.sh
REMOTE_HOST $
REMOTE_HOST $ tail -f logs/jospJOD.log
REMOTE_HOST $ tail -f logs/console.log    // includes more details (p.e. SIGTERM)
REMOTE_HOST $
REMOTE_HOST $ bash stop.sh
REMOTE_HOST $ exit
```

or as foreground process:

```shell title="Test distribution remotely as Foreground process"
$ bash script/publish.sh
$ scp build/publications/{DEST_ARTIFACT}-{DEST_VER}.tgz [{REMOTE_USER}@]{REMOTE_HOST}:{REMOTE_PATH}
$ ssh [{REMOTE_USER}@]{REMOTE_HOST}
REMOTE_HOST $ cd {REMOTE_PATH}
REMOTE_HOST $ tar -xvz {DEST_ARTIFACT}-{DEST_VER}.tgz
REMOTE_HOST $ cd {DEST_ARTIFACT}-{DEST_VER}
REMOTE_HOST $ bash start.sh true
                < Type exit to halt the JOD Agent
REMOTE_HOST $ exit
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="powershell">

Publish, upload and run remotely JOD Distribution as a background process and review his logs:

```shell title="Test distribution remotely as Background process"
TODO Write Test distribution remotely as Background process
```

or as foreground process:

```shell title="Test distribution remotely as Foreground process"
TODO Write Test distribution remotely as Foreground process
