# Object PRE-POST scripts

End Users use [JOD Distribution Commands](https://bitbucket.org/johnosproject_shared/com.robypomper.josp.jod.template/src/develop/docs/dists/dists.md) to manage their JOD Distribution installation. They can start/stop, install/uninstall (as a service) and get his state.

[JOD Distribution Commands](https://bitbucket.org/johnosproject_shared/com.robypomper.josp.jod.template/src/develop/docs/dists/dists.md), during their execution, are configured to check for special scripts in the ```script``` folder; if those scripts exist, then they are executed.

Those special scripts act as hooks and allow Makers to inject distribution's specific commands to be executed before or after start/stop, install/uninstall the distribution.

Here the full list of JOD Distribution Commands, and the hook they try to call:

| JOD Dist Cmd | PRE-Script | POST_Script |
|---|---|---|
| start             | ```scripts/pre-startup```   | ```scripts/post-startup```   |
| start FOREGROUND  | ```scripts/pre-startup```   | ```scripts/post-shutdown```  |
| stop              | ```scripts/pre-shutdown```  | ```scripts/post-shutdown```  |
| install           | ```scripts/pre-install```   | ```scripts/post-install```   |
| uninstall         | ```scripts/pre-uninstall``` | ```scripts/post-uninstall``` |

:::note Depending on which version of the JOD Distribution Commands is executed (Bash or Powershell), corresponding PRE-POST script (sh or ps1) will be used as hook.<br/>
So the PRE script executed by ```bash start.sh``` will be the ```scripts/pre-startup.sh``` scripts, meanwhile for the ```powershell uninstall.ps1``` command, the POST hook is the ```scripts/post-uninstall.ps1```.
:::

The ```start``` JOD Dist Cmd always call the ```scripts/pre-startup``` hook before the JOD agent execution. But, when the distribution startup as a FOREGROUND process, it does NOT call the ```scripts/post-startup``` hook as usual, instead it execute the ```scripts/post-shutdown``` hook. That assures Maker a place where put their startup/shutdown code independently to the ```start``` JOD Dist Cmd working mode (background or foreground).

## Common PRE-POST operations

PRE and POST script are useful in many case to customize

### Check working Operating System

Many JOD Distribution are implemented to work only on a specific OS(s).<br/>
If that's you case, we suggest adding an OS check to each PRE-hook.

<Tabs groupId="os-shell"
defaultValue="bash"
values={[
{label: 'Linux/Mac', value: 'bash'}, {label: 'Windows', value: 'powershell'},
]}>
<TabItem value="bash">

```shell title="pre-XYZ.sh:wrong OS check"
# Check supported OS
supportedOS=("Unix" "BSD" "Solaris")
failOnUnsupportedOS "${supportedOS[@]}"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="powershell">

```shell title="pre-XYZ.ps1:wrong OS check"
# Check supported OS
$supportedOS="Unix", "BSD", "Solaris"
failOnUnsupportedOS $supportedOS
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

In the previous example we added a check that fails if executing OS is not in the ```supportedOS``` list. With 'executing OS' we are referring to OS where your JOD Distribution were installed by End User.

Available OS names are:

* ```Unix```
* ```MacOS```
* ```BSD```
* ```Solaris```
* ```Win32```

### Requirements checks

If your distribution require special hardware configuration, 3rd party software or specific files installed on execution OS, you can add custom checks to the ```pre-startup``` and/or ```pre-install``` hooks. So if checks fail, End user can't startup/install the JOSP object and receive detailed message on what was wrong.

**Check command availability:**

<Tabs groupId="os-shell"
defaultValue="bash"
values={[
{label: 'Linux/Mac', value: 'bash'}, {label: 'Windows', value: 'powershell'},
]}>
<TabItem value="bash">

```shell title="dists/resources/scripts/pre-startup.sh:check 'top' command availability"
# Check top
if command -v top &>/dev/null; then
  echo "'top' command installed"
else
  echo "Missing Java, please install it"
  logFat "'top' command not installed, exit"
fi
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="powershell">

```shell title="dists/resources/scripts/pre-startup.ps1:check 'top' command availability"
ToDo: Write dists/resources/scripts/pre-startup.ps1:check 'top' command availability
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

A common tip, is to implement all requirements checks in the ```pre-startup``` script, then call it from the ```pre-install``` script. That allow you to write them only once. See [Hook script call another Hook script](#hook-script-call-another-hook-script).

### Execution environment setup

Often occurs that a distribution must perform some setup to the environment where it will be executed by the End User.

Here an example that set executable all script contained in the ```scripts/sendors``` directory.

<Tabs groupId="os-shell"
defaultValue="bash"
values={[
{label: 'Linux/Mac', value: 'bash'}, {label: 'Windows', value: 'powershell'},
]}>
<TabItem value="bash">

```shell title="dists/resources/scripts/pre-startup.sh:setup execution environment"
# Set sensors scripts executables
chmod +x $SCRIPT_DIR/sensors/*
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="powershell">

```shell title="dists/resources/scripts/pre-startup.ps1:setup execution environment"
ToDo: Write dists/resources/scripts/pre-startup.ps1:setup execution environment
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Remember that the PRE-POST hooks are called every time the End User execute a JOD Dist Cmd, so if you would do some operations only once, please add some check before it to avoid repeating same operations each hook execution.

### PreStartup initialization and PostShutdown cleanup

Sometimes a JOD Distribution must perform some operations before his startup (init) and after his shutdown (clean). For example to enable and then disable some service required during the JOD agent execution.

You can add initialization commands to the ```pre-startup``` hooks and the cleanup comands to ```post-shutdown```. Those commands will always be called during JOD Agent startup and shutdown even if it executed as foreground process or installed as a service.

### Dynamic configurations (object info and struct)

Another reason to use the PRE hooks is to generate a dynamic configurations for your distribution like the object's structure. That's made possible by adding generation commands to the ```pre-startup``` hook.

Following example use the ```JOD_MWO_LOCATION``` value from [distribution specific configs](/docs/references/tools/jod_dist_template/create_your_own_jod_distribution/configuration/object_configs#jod-configs) and replace it with corresponding placeholder in the ```struct_TMPL.jod``` file, then save result to the ```configs/struct.jod``` file.

<Tabs groupId="os-shell"
defaultValue="bash"
values={[
{label: 'Linux/Mac', value: 'bash'}, {label: 'Windows', value: 'powershell'},
]}>
<TabItem value="bash">

```shell title="dists/resources/scripts/pre-startup.sh:generate struct.jod file dynamically"
JOD_STRUCT_TMPL=$JOD_DIR/struct_TMPL.jod
JOD_STRUCT=$JOD_DIR/configs/struct.jod
logInf "Update JOD instance's structure to Location = $JOD_MWO_LOCATION"
sed -e "s/\${JOD_MWO_LOCATION}/$JOD_MWO_LOCATION/" $JOD_STRUCT_TMPL >$JOD_STRUCT
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="powershell">

```shell title="dists/resources/scripts/pre-startup.ps1:generate struct.jod file dynamically"
ToDo: Write dists/resources/scripts/pre-startup.ps1:generate struct.jod file dynamically
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

More complex object's structure can be generated using the APIs from ```scripts/jod/struct/builder.sh``` script provided by the JOD Distribution TEMPLATE. **NB!*: This is an experimental feature, and it's available only for bash version.

:::note You can generate dynamically not just the object's structure, but also any other script/configs/resource required by your distribution.
:::

### Hook script call another hook script

When two or more Hook scripts must perform same operations, you can write all commands once in a single Hook script. Then call it from all other Hook scripts.

Here the ```pre-install``` script example that call the ```pre-startup``` hook:

<Tabs groupId="os-shell"
defaultValue="bash"
values={[
{label: 'Linux/Mac', value: 'bash'}, {label: 'Windows', value: 'powershell'},
]}>
<TabItem value="bash">

```shell title="pre-install.sh:call pre-startup.sh hook"
logInf "Execute pre-startup.sh..."
if [ -f "$JOD_DIR/scripts/pre-startup.sh" ]; then
execScriptCommand $JOD_DIR/scripts/pre-startup.sh || ( [ "$?" -gt "0" ] \
&& logWar "Error executing PRE startup script, exit $?" && exit $? \
|| logWar "Error executing PRE startup script, continue $?" )
else
logDeb "PRE startup script not found, skipped (missing $JOD_DIR/scripts/pre-startup.sh)"
fi
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="powershell">

```shell title="pre-install.ps1:call pre-startup.ps1 hook"
ToDo: Write pre-install.ps1:call pre-startup.ps1 hook
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Distribution specific configs

The PRE-POST scripts in conjunction with the [JOD Configs](/docs/references/tools/jod_dist_template/create_your_own_jod_distribution/configuration/object_configs#jod-configs) file are a powerful tool to create JOD Distribution that can adapt their self to the execution environment and end user needs.

Just declaring your variables in the ```dists/configs/jod_configs.sh|ps1``` file from your distribution project dir, they will be available also to the PRE-POST scripts. Then, End user can easily configure distribution behaviour simply editing the JOD Config file.

### Define distribution config

Define ```JOD_MWO_LOCATION``` variable to the ```dists/configs/jod_configs.sh|ps1``` file with a default value.

<Tabs groupId="os-shell"
defaultValue="bash"
values={[
{label: 'Linux/Mac', value: 'bash'}, {label: 'Windows', value: 'powershell'},
]}>
<TabItem value="bash">

```shell title="dists/configs/jod_configs.sh:define distribution specific configs"
# ############### #
# MyDist's config #
# ############### #

# My Dist XY config
# Config desription and values examples
# set a value as default value or keep it as empty string ""
export JOD_MWO_LOCATION="Rome"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="powershell">

```shell title="dists/configs/jod_configs.ps1:define distribution specific configs"
ToDo: Write dists/configs/jod_configs.ps1:define distribution specific configs
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Use distribution config from a PRE-POST script

Read ```JOD_MWO_LOCATION``` variable value from the ```dists/resources/scripts/pre-startup.sh|ps1``` script.

<Tabs groupId="os-shell"
defaultValue="bash"
values={[
{label: 'Linux/Mac', value: 'bash'}, {label: 'Windows', value: 'powershell'},
]}>
<TabItem value="bash">

```shell title="dists/resources/scripts/pre-startup.sh:read distribution specific configs"
logInf "Update JOD instance's structure to Location = $JOD_MWO_LOCATION"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="powershell">

```shell title="dists/resources/scripts/pre-startup.ps1:read distribution specific configs"
ToDo: Write dists/resources/scripts/pre-startup.ps1:read distribution specific configs
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
