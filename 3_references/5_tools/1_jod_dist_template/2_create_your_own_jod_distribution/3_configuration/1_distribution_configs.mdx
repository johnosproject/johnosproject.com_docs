# Distribution configs

Before building your own distribution, you must edit the ```configs/jod_dist_configs.sh|ps1``` file and populate his properties.

When executed, all [JOD Template Commands](https://bitbucket.org/johnosproject_shared/com.robypomper.josp.jod.template/src/develop/docs/tmpl/tmpl.md) use the default ```configs/jod_dist_configs.sh|ps1``` distribution's configs file. Passing them the ```JOD_DIST_CONFIG_FILE``` param allow you to build/install/publish JOD Distribution using different configurations, for example for separate development/testing/release configs.
