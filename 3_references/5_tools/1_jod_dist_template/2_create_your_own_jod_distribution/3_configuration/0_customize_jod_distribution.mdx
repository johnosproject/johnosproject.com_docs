# Customize JOD Distribution

**A JOD Distribution can represent any kind of object in a JOSP EcoSystem, depending on his configs.**

All JOD Distribution projects based on the JOD Dist TMPL, must run the build process to generate their distributable files. So you can **configure the build process to customize the output distribution**.<br/>
The JOD Distribution TEMPLATE provide a main configuration config files. The ```configs/jod_dist_configs.sh|ps1``` files contains the main distribution's configs like his name, his version, the JOD version to use, the JCP credentials, etc... This file is used by ```build.sh|ps1``` script to configure the build process.<br/>
On other side, the build process, assemble the distribution using files contained in the ```dists``` dir. The JOD Dist TMPL provide all those files. Mandatory files are provided with the right name, so you must only edit existing files. Other, non mandatory files, are provided with ```_EXAMPLE``` extension, so you need to rename them to enable them. Those files allow you to configure object, to customize his structure, to inject PRE-POST scripts and to add resources to the assembled distribution.

Here the build process diagram:

At [JOD Distributions list](/docs/references/jod_dists/) page of the JOSP Docs, you can find many **ready-to-use JOD Distributions**. Depending on what you would integrate to the JOSP EcoSystem as an Object, maybe there is already a JOD Distribution for your needs. Otherwise, use them as examples for your custom JOD Distribution.<br/>
