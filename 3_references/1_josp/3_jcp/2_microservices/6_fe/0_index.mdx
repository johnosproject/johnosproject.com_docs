**The John Cloud Platform Front End provides the management Web Dashboard**, a Web Site where Users, Makers and Developers can manage their JOSP Objects.

This JCP Microservice is composed by a [SpringBoot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) application that provide a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)/[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) application as static content.
The main [React](https://reactjs.org/) application use the [MUI](https://mui.com/) library as main UI components framework.

With the JCP Front End (static) application all users from a JOSP EcoSystem can manage their JOSP Objects.
In the web site, End User, Makers and Developers can list and check object's activities.<br/>
For the **JCP Front End usage, check the [Users guide](usage)**.

The JCP Front End expose also the [/ Entry Point](apis#entry_point) API (implemented in the Spring side of the JCP FE).<br/>
This API return the [JCP JSL Web Bridge](../jslwb)'s public url and allow clients (like a browser) initialize a new JSL session.
The JSL Session, must be request by the JCP FE to the JCP JSL WB, because the JSL Session require the JOSP Service's id and secret (from the JCP FE).
To keep his credentials private, the JCP FE don't share them within the client side code.
Instead the client require to the JCP FE to create a new JSL Session to the JCP JSL WB on his own.
