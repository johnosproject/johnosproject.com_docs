# JCP Front End Show JOSP Object's status and his history

import YoutubeVideo from '../../../../../_video_youtube.mdx'

Once you [added a new JOSP Object](register_a_josp_object) or another [user shared an object](share_object_with_user) with you, you can list all object's pillars and you can display their histories.

From the ```Objects``` section of the JCP Front End, click on the JOSP Object's name to open the **object's page**.<br/>
Here, near each State or Action pillar, there is a ```clock``` icon.
If you can't see it, unfold the object's structure.<br/>
Click to that icon, to open the status history page for corresponding Pillar (remember that also Action pillar have their own status).

Because you can browse the object's also when it's offline (not connected to the JCP).
When an object's is offline, his status history pages display latest values received.
On object's reconnection (to the JCP) all missing values are uploaded to JCP.
That is made possible from the JOD Agent that [cache object's status histories](/docs/references/josp/jod/specs/files#cache) until the JCP is not reachable.

In the status history page a graph display the object's status time-series.
You can download that time-series data clicking on the ```Download``` link in the ```Details``` (3 vertical dots) menu.
