The JCP Front End home page displays a summary of available JOSP Objects and their activity.

Like any other JCP Front End Page is composed by a section menu (on left side) and a user bottom (on top-right).
With those links you can access to Front End's sections and to the user's account page.

* Home: dashboard with object's summary
* Objects: list of all available objects
* About: info about JCP Front End as current JOSP Service
* User account: login/register/logut user and info about his account
