# JCP Front End Users guide

This is the Users guide for the JCP Front End.
The JCP Front End allow users to manage their objects.

To create your own JOSP EcoSystem is required an user account on the [JCP](https://www.johnosproject.org/frontend).<br/>
Then you can start adding your JOSP Objects to the JCP and set yourself as object's owner.
Once you power on / ran you JOSP Objects and copied his [object's id](/docs/references/josp/jod/specs/object_id), you can proceed with the object's registration procedure.<br/>
Now you can start play with you JOSP Object, share it with your friends and allow other JOSP Service access to it.

All **Users guide's How-To videos** are also available from the [JCP Front End 2.2.1 @ Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOi0thuec1961qiTk5avfuUw61NQnL5UG) playlist from the [John O.S. Project](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb4HveVMSmCaSaluou6D3xQ) channel.
