To register a JOSP Object, it must be running (as AnonymousObject), connected to the Public JCP and you must know his [object's id](/references/josp/jod/specs/object_id).<br/>
Then you can proceed to open the [JCP front End](https:://www.johnosproject.org/frontend) home page and got to the ```Object``` sections and follow below instructions:

1. (if not) [login](login_user_account) with your credentials to the JCP Front End
1. click on ```+ Add Object``` button on the top-right of the objects list
1. insert the object's id to register in the dialog and proceed
1. after a message that tell you the JOSP Object was found, it set current user as a object's owner
1. after a minute you should receive a notification that the object was registered successfully
1. you can find new object in the object's list

After that you can update the object's name. Go to the object's page and click on the edit icon near object's name.
Update the name and save. Now all your JOSP Services see the new object's name.
