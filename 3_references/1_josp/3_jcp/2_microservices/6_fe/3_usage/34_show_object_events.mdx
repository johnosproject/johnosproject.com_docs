# JCP Front End Show JOSP Object's events

import YoutubeVideo from '../../../../../_video_youtube.mdx'

Once you [added a new JOSP Object](register_a_josp_object) or another [user shared an object](share_object_with_user) with you, you can see the object's page and his events.

From the ```Objects``` section of the JCP Front End, click on the JOSP Object's name to open the **object's page**.<br/>
Here, on the top of the page click on ```Events``` link.

In the object's event page you can see the timeline of events.
To improve readability, they are parted by day and hours.<br/>
For every hour during which the JOSP Objects was running (also if not connected to the JCP) you can find an events summary.
With the total count of object's events during that hour, states/actions messages and a pie chart that groups events by type.

For more details on object's event click on the ```Show event list``` link to show raw events.

Because you can browse the object's also when it's offline (not connected to the JCP).
When an object's is offline, you can display his events until he disconnect to the JCP.
On object's reconnection (to the JCP) all missing events are uploaded to JCP.
That is made possible from the JOD Agent that [cache object's event](/docs/references/josp/jod/specs/files#cache) until the JCP is not reachable.

You can download raw object's events clicking on the ```Download``` link in the ```Details``` (3 vertical dots) menu.
