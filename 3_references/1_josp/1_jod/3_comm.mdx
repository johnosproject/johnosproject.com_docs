# JOD Agent Communication system

**To connect  a [JOSP Object](/what/josp/object) to a [JOSP EcoSystem](/what/josp/ecosystem), the JOD Agent use a complex communication system.**<br/>
This system is delegated to handle communication with JOSP Services (both [Direct](/what/josp/specs/comm#direct) and [Cloud](/what/josp/specs/comm#cloud)), manage JCP Authentication, but also to encrypt all tx/rx data.

Because a **JOSP EcoSystem is composed by different 'pieces', a JOD Agent use multiple communication channels** with different protocols to talks with all those 'pieces':

* to JCP APIs (via HTTP) to register and handle the JOSP object to the JCP
* to JCP Gateways (via JOSP) to communicate with JOSP Services via Cloud Communication
* from JOSP Services (via JOSP) to communicate with JOSP Services via Direct Communication

[JCP APIs](/references/josp/jcp/microservices/apis) are a set of HTTP Methods exposed by the JCP platform and are used by JOD Agent to handle the JOSP Object on the JCP.
That include: the generation of an unique object's id, the supply of the JCP GWs access info, the storage of JOSP Object's events and status histories, etc...<br/>
Moreover JCP APIs requires [JOD Agent authentication](#jcp-authentication) via the JCP Auth service (an OAuth2 authorization server).

To communicate with JOSP Services, the JOD Agent support both JOSP Communications types: [Direct](/what/josp/specs/comm#direct) and [Cloud](/what/josp/specs/comm#cloud).

For **Cloud Communication**, the JOD Agent open a connection to the [JCP Gateways](/references/josp/jcp/microservices/gws).
So all JOSP Services (with at lest [STATUS permission](specs/permissions) on the JOSP Object represented by the JOD Agent) can see exposed JOSP Object and interact with it via Cloud communication.<br/>
The JOD Agent use internal [JOD Gateway O2S Client](#jod-gateway-o2s-client), that support [JOSP protocol](/what/josp/specs/protocol), to connect with the JCP GW.
You can disable Cloud Communication setting the ```jod.comm.cloud.enabled``` property from [JOD AGent Configs](specs/configs) to ```false``` (it's ```true``` by default).
So the jod gateway client is not initialized at JOD Agent startup.

On the other side, for **Direct Communication** the JOD Agent startup a local server and publish it as mDNS/Bonjour service on local network.
That allow all JOSP Services on the same local network to discover and connect to the JOSP Object exposed by the JOD Agent.<br/>
[Local JOD Server](#jod-local-server) support the [JOSP protocol](/what/josp/specs/protocol) and is executed at JOD Agent startup.<br/>
You can disable Direct Communication setting the ```jod.comm.local.enabled``` property from [JOD AGent Configs](specs/configs) to ```false``` (it's ```true``` by default).
So the local server is not executed at JOD Agent startup.

With the intention of **providing the highest level of security**, both the [JOD Gateway O2S Client](#od-gateway-o2s-client) and the [JOD Local Server](#jod-local-server) use communication channels based on TCP and encrypted with SSL.
For Cloud communication, the SSL encryption use a pre-shared certificate on the JCP GWs server side; and a self-generated certificate as JOSP Object's identity.
Each JOSP Object, register his self-generated certificate to the JCP when requires the JCP GW's access info to JCP APIs.
On other hand, the Direct communication require a pre-connection step where JOSP Object and Service share their own certificates.
After that, they can open a direct encrypted communication.

Also the [Public JCP](/references/josp/jcp/public_jcp), with the aim to improve your security, expose only HTTPs endpoints and encrypt all communication with his own SSL certificate.
