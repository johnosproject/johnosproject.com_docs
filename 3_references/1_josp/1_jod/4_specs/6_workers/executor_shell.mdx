# JOD Worker Executor Shell

When an [JOD Action](../pillars#actions) must be executed, this executor execute the ```cmd``` using the [JavaExecProcess::execCmdConcat(String cmd)](https://bitbucket.org/johnosproject_shared/com.robypomper.josp/src/2.2.1/src/jospCommons/java/com/robypomper/java/JavaExecProcess.java#lines-150) method.

Before execute the command, the ```cmd``` string is updated and all his placeholder are replaced with current [Pillar](workers_placeholders#pillar), [State](workers_placeholders#state) and [Action](workers_placeholders#action) properties.<br/>
After that execute the command.

## Firmware Configs

### ```cmd```

String containing the shell command to execute via [JavaExecProcess::execCmdConcat(String cmd)](https://bitbucket.org/johnosproject_shared/com.robypomper.josp/src/2.2.1/src/jospCommons/java/com/robypomper/java/JavaExecProcess.java#lines-169) method with 5 seconds as timeout. **It's mandatory.**

The ```cmd``` string can contain any available command on running machine and his all params.<br/>
It also support piped command (```|```) for example ```echo "hello world" | sed 's/world/john/g'```.
The ```cmd``` string can concatenate multiple commands with ```&&```.

The concatenated commands are executed independently, so before executing each cmd, this method wait for previous cmd termination.<br/>
Each cmd must be terminate before {@link #DEF_TIMEOUT}.

This property is updated with [Pillar's Placeholder](workers_placeholders#pillar) on worker initialization and with [State Placeholder](workers_placeholders#state) and [Action Placeholder](workers_placeholders#state) on executing action.

### ```redirect```

File path where write ```cmd``` output. Default value ''.

If this firmware Configs is set, it used as file path for write command output as logs file.

This property is updated with [Pillar's Placeholder](workers_placeholders#pillar) on worker initialization and with [State Placeholder](workers_placeholders#state) and [Action Placeholder](workers_placeholders#state) on executing action.
