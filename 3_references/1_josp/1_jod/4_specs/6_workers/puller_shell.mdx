# JOD Worker Puller Shell

Each ```freq``` seconds, this puller execute the ```cmd``` using the [JavaExecProcess::execCmd(String cmd)](https://bitbucket.org/johnosproject_shared/com.robypomper.josp/src/2.2.1/src/jospCommons/java/com/robypomper/java/JavaExecProcess.java#lines-80) method , then update the [JOD State](../pillars#state).

Before execute the command, the ```cmd``` string is updated and all his placeholder are replaced with current [Pillar](workers_placeholders#pillar) and [State](workers_placeholders#state) properties.<br/>
Once executed the shell command, it takes his output and pass it as new Pillar's state, independently to the Pillar's type.
